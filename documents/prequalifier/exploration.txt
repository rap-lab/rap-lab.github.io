Title:  Autonomous Exploration of Unknown Environments
Brief intro of the project:
Exploration seeks to navigate one or multiple autonomous robots to quickly map a bounded unknown environment. It involves multiple key components such as, motion planning and mapping. Our goal is to develop novel algorithms for exploration in the real world.

Job description/workload
Students' job includes algorithm development, data analysis, and implementation of algorithms in both simulation and on real-world robots. The workload is expected to be at least 12 hours per week.

Keywords of this project
Robotics, Motion Planning, Autonomous Exploration

Eligibility (sophomore, junior or senior, major requirement, etc)
Students must be familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System), and do well in the test at https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_exploration_sim_test as specified in the readme file there.
Send your solutions to zhongqiang.ren@sjtu.edu.cn in a zip that contains 
1. a folder containing all your source code
2. a video demonstrating the exploration process of your method in the simulation

Recommended Background Knowledge:
Ideally, you should be familiar with basic graph search algorithms (e.g., A*, JPS), sampling-based methods (e.g., RRT, RRT*), control methods such as PID, MPC, LQR. Some knowledge about SLAM algorithm (e.g., FastLIO, VINS, LIO-SAM, or A-LOAM) and basic understanding of common map representations such as 2D grid maps and 3D OctoMap will also help a lot in this project.
Finally, it is preferred if you have basic knowledge of using common sensors such as MID360 Lidar or Intel Realsense, and understanding how to use ROS to acquire sensor data and control the robot platform.
