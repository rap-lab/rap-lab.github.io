For many motion planning problems, there is currently no algorithm available in the literature to find an optimal solution. While finding the optimum is challenging, there are many algorithms that can compute a feasible solution such as search-based or sampling-based methods. 
A natural and fundamental question is: how close a feasible solution actually is to the (true) optimum. In the absence of methods for finding the optimum, lower bounds can be used as proxies to the optimum. Baseline approaches that find trivial lower bounds are always possible. However, these bounds tend to be far away from the optimum, and therefore, do not serve as good estimates of the optimum. The goal of this research is to develop approaches that can provide tight lower-bounding estimates of the true optimum to motion planning problems.

We begin by considering a Motion Planning Problem with Dynamic Obstacles (MPDO) in 2D that requires finding a minimum-arrival-time collision-free trajectory for a point robot between its start and goal locations amid dynamic obstacles moving along known trajectories. We develop an approach that can provide tight lower bounds to the optimum, which consists of (i) a bi-level discretization approach that converts the MPDO to a relaxed path planning problem, and (ii) an algorithm that can solve the relaxed problem to obtain lower bounds. The proposed bi-level discretization approach simultaneously handles the collision avoidance constraints and the generation of tight lower bounds. We theoretically show that our approach generates lower bounds and the experimental results show that the bounds obtained by our approach for some instances are up to twice tighter than a baseline approach showcasing potential advantages of the proposed approach.
